# Mission Game

A simple web-based game built with Phaser 3 for exploring a California Mission.

## Running the Game

Since this is a web-based game, you'll need a local web server to run it. Here are a few easy ways to do this:

### Using Python (simplest)

If you have Python installed, you can run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8000

### Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed, you can install a simple http server:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then run:

```bash
http-server
```

And open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to move the character around the screen
- More controls will be added as the game develops

## Development

This is a work in progress. The current version includes:

- Basic game setup with Phaser 3
- A movable green circle character
- Basic keyboard controls
